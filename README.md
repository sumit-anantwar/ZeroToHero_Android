Zero To Hero : Android
----------------------

Building an App is easy. But. building a Scalable, Maintainable, Performant and Testable App is really difficult.
It takes years of experience and countless hours of searching and studying, to finally arrive at a point where Abstraction and Performance live harmoniously in the world of DRY and SOLID code ( although that sounds kind of grey, trust me, this new world is made up of colorful flowers and butterflies! ).

### To the learners:
There are many fragmented tutorials grown like mushrooms all over the internet. But, none of them provide a single source of truth. None of them provide a complete implementation, with all the nits and pieces working flawlessly together, which one can refer to and be confident enough to step out and face those mean and geeky senior developers.

This app is an essence of all my experience. It aims to be a breath of fresh air, a legitimate head-starter for all the wanna-be mobile enthusiasts.

I will try my best to keep the commit history as "step-by-step" as possible, and the commit messages as descriptive as possible. Although a series of articles explaining all the details will soon follow.

##### Concepts covered :
1. **Kotlin:** Yes, the app will be written 100% in Kotlin. Don't you already smell the flowers?
2. **MVP:** RIP MVC, long live MVP! Abstraction and separation of responsibilities are really important for writing scalable, maintainable and testable code. To achieve this we will be using the Model, View, Presenter pattern.
3. **Dependency Injection:** Breaking the dependency tree is the second most important thing at creating maintainable apps. We will use the magical Dagger 2 framework for this.
4. **TDD:** Remember those geeky seniors? You need the confidence to face them! TDD will give you that exact confidence. With TDD's "rapid response cycles" you can be totally sure that your code works. And when you optimize or update any part of the code, TDD will give you an immediate feedback about the impact of that change.
**Spoiler Alert: TDD is addictive! Once you become a TDDer, it would be impossible to look back!**
5. **Rx:** Although you can develop a maintainable and scalable app without it, Rx is like a cherry topping which makes every dessert complete! And yes, functional reactive programming is the future. So, I would strongly recommend you to go ahead and eat the dessert.

### To the Experts:
No matter how much we know, there is always more to learn. And, I am sure there would be enough room for improvement in all the approaches that I have tried to cover in this app. Please be candid enough to slap it on my face. I would heartily accept them!
